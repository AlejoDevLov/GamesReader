#Console Application for Video Game Data Deserialization

This application reads and deserializes video game data  from a JSON file. 
It is robust and should not crash under any circumstances. 
Any unhandled exceptions are written to the log file.

It is a personal project to practice exception handling and logging in C# and applying
Clean code and SOLID principles.
