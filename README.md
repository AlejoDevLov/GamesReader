# Console Application for Video Game Data Deserialization

This application reads and deserializes video game data  from a JSON file. 
It is robust and should not crash under any circumstances. 
Any unhandled exceptions are written to the log file.

It is a personal project to practice exception handling and logging errors in C# as well as applying
Clean code and SOLID principles.

## How to Use
For this project I read two static JSON files containing video game data. You can find them in the `JsonExamplefiles` folder.
There is one file for correct data and one file with incorrect data to test the exception handling and logging functionality.
You have to move them to the root of the app in the bin folder before running and testing the project.
